# What all you need to know about the cutting method and processing meats?
## Overview
Meat is a muscle that is made of fibers and they are held together by connective tissues like elastin and collagen. The connective tissue amount in the muscle or meat needs to be acknowledged before selecting the correct way to prepare the final product. In this article, we are going to discuss in detail the method of cutting and processing meat as discussed by the [best butcher](https://rocknrollbutcher.com.au/) Brisbane.

## Different meat cuts and their cooking process
●	The highly exercised muscle like shank or shoulder area will develop much more with connective tissues and they have more coarse fibers. This means a moist cooking method is needed. When it is cooked with liquid, the collagen breaks down at 80 degrees Celsius into gelatin. This gelatin provides cooking liquid and adds moisture to the cooked meat and gives it a rich flavor. 
●	A lightly exercised muscle will contain less connective tissue and more fine muscle fibers will allow it to be prepared with a dry heat cooking method. For this type of meat, the best choice is Beef tenderloin.
●	Generally, four-legged animals use the shoulder and leg muscles the most and cut them from the areas which have connective tissues and they are less tender. 
●	The rib, back, and lion section contain muscles that are not used that often and they are the source of the more tender choices and cuts of meat. 
It is not surprising and therefore the cuts from these sections tend to be on higher prices and they are featured on the restaurant menus. The main species and the physical structure are similar and cuts are named differently and they are regulated by the food inspection agency. 

## The price will vary accordingly
The cuts from these sections tend to be on the higher side and they are included in the restaurant menus. Additionally, the physical structure and muscles are different with each option like sheep or any other animal. 
It might be possible that in different countries the same cut of meat can be referred to as a different name. Understanding the meat cuts to be sold at a retail level must be labeled according to the CFIA standard. The same rule does not apply to the sale of whole muscles or restaurant cuts which need to be advertised on a menu. 

## General cutting procedures and terms
Meat animals are generally broken down from large carcasses into sub-primal and primal cuts. These are animals' large parts which can be further broken down into restaurant cuts or detail. In some cases, primal and subprimal are cooked as a whole. But, most of them are cut into smaller pieces for having different portion cuts. Some of the options include:
●	Roasts
Boneless or bone-in large cuts are meant to be cooked whole and then sliced following into portions
●	Racks
Most common with lamb and pork are a special type of roast that contains the rib bones and trimmed to show the bone-white portion. Bones that are trimmed with this method are referred to as frenched.
